//Declare an empty string
var noise = "";


//store anonymous function in var laugh
var laugh = function (num) {
    
//Iterate. What is the function to do?
//Starting at x=0 and running until x is less than num, add 1 to x each time
for (var x = 0 ; x < num ; x++) {
    
    //Noise now = empty string + "ha"; this will repeat until x !< num
        noise = noise + "ha" ;  
    }
    
    //All the multiples of "ha" now = "noise"; this adds the exclamation at the end
    noise = noise +"!"; 
    
    //this returns the whole thing and stops the function running
    return noise; 
}

//this console.log is calling var laugh (which calls the function)
console.log(laugh(6));
